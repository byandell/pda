Practical Data Analysis for Designed Experiments (book add-on)

This R package is not on CRAN. To install, first do the following once:

> install.packages("devtools")

If on Windows, you will then need to install Rtools from http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools , which is an executable that will install some applications in c:\Rtools. 

You will also need pdflatex, which means you need a TeX distribution such as MikTeX or TeX Live.

You can now install this or other libraries from github. For PDA library, do the following:

> library(devtools)
> install_github("pda", "byandell")
